## Ingredients
* Good quality spaghetti (preferably one that's been extruded through a bronze die for 
texture)
* Garlic, peeled and thinly sliced
* Fresh chili, top and tailed, seeds removed, and thinly sliced
* Fresh parsley, leaves picked and roughly chopped
* Lemon juice
* Olive oil
* Salt (for pasta water)
* Pasta water

## Instructions
1.	Cooking the Pasta
* Boil about 2 to 2.5 liters of water in a pot. Add a generous amount of salt to 
the water - it should taste as salty as the sea.
* Once the water is boiling, add the spaghetti. Cook it according to the package 
instructions, typically around 11 to 13 minutes, until al dente.
2.	Preparing the Sauce
* In a large pan, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Be careful not to 
overheat the oil.
* Add the thinly sliced garlic to the oil. Cook it gently, ensuring it softens and 
becomes translucent without taking on too much color.
* Add the sliced chili to the pan with the garlic. If the heat is too high and 
things are cooking too quickly, turn off the heat momentarily.
* Once the garlic is soft and fragrant, add a couple of ladles of pasta water to 
the pan to create a sauce base.
3.	Combining Pasta and Sauce
* Drain the cooked spaghetti and add it to the pan with the garlic and chili.
* Toss the pasta in the sauce, allowing it to absorb the flavors and for the sauce 
to cling to the pasta. You can do this by gently stirring or tossing in the pan.
4.	Finishing the Dish
* Once the pasta is well coated with the sauce, turn off the heat.
* Add the freshly chopped parsley and a generous squeeze of lemon juice to 
the pasta. Mix well to combine.
5.	Plating
* Serve the spaghetti immediately. The sauce should be lightly coating the 
pasta, with a nice balance of garlic, chili, and the fresh zing of lemon.

this is by using a blender to get the cheese super fine.

form a creamy paste. This step is crucial for avoiding lumps and ensuring a 
smooth sauce.

* Transfer the slightly undercooked pasta into the pan with the toasted black 
pepper.
* Add a bit of the pasta water to the pan and finish cooking the pasta, allowing 
the water to reduce and concentrate the starch.
6.	Finishing the Dish

turn off the heat.
* Add the cheese emulsion to the pasta and toss it to combine everything into

4. Place the lamb on top of the onions, cover with a sheet of baking parchment and then the lid.
5. Place into your oven for around 5 hours, check the lamb with a fork to make sure it's very tender, if not re-cover and give it another 30 mins.
